# 🍔 Heisenburger 
My simple Java project as a first year college student. Heisenburger is a desktop Point of Sale (POS) system built using **Java**, and **JavaFX**, designed for small food businesses, burger joints, or fast food outlets. Inspired by *Breaking Bad*, the system combines simplicity with functionality to streamline customer transactions and order management.

## 🧠 Features  
- ✅ User login and authentication  
- 🍔 Order management (add, edit, cancel orders)  
- 💾 Persistent data storage using object serialization  
- 🧾 Receipt printing
